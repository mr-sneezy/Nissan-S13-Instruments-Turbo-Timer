# Nissan-S13-Instruments-Turbo-Timer
A historical repo for a project to build my own supplemental gauges and a turbo timer all in one. Completed in 1999. 
Written (badly) for PicBasic Compiler and a PIC16C715 MCU. 
Code may be of some use as code examples for scaling Nissan engine sensors for a new project.
